As far as I can remember I have always been interested in understanding what the universe is made of, it is then natural that my research interests lie at the frontier of fundamental physics. For decades, high energy colliders have been offering some of the most interesting experimental opportunities to expand our knowledge of fundamental physics and discover new physics phenomena. Over the past ten years, I have pursued a diverse research program including precision measurements in the top sector, searches for new particles at the LHC and beyond and development of detector concepts at the FCC. 

\vskip 0.3 cm
In the document entitled {\bf Statement of Research Interest} I will summarise my ambitious plans and involvements for the next five/ten years, that I would be carrying out in conjunction with PhD student(s)/ postdoc(s) if they were available. 

\vskip 0.3 cm
My {\bf Curriculum Vitae} perfectly reflects that I am constantly looking for new interesting challenges to tackle, always with the same, or even stronger motivation than at the beginning of my carrier. Thanks to all the experience acquired in different areas over the last ten years, I became a physicist with a global vision of the field. I am now ready to move to the next step of my carrier by applying to this position, and I hope it will get your attention.
